# mlmm ( version: alpha )
multiallelic linear mixed model

This is a tookit used to perform GWAS analysis with some output from our software Irisas (https://github.com/baoxingsong/Irisas)
mlmm and the multiple allelic function in Irisas have not been well tested yet.
This pipeline only works for homozygous genetic diversity.
All the multiallelic models implemented here have biases. I did not observe convincing information that suggest multiallelic models always outperform biallelic model.
