# mlmm ( version: alpha )
multiallelic linear mixed model

This is a tookit used to perform GWAS analysis with some output from our software Irisas (https://github.com/baoxingsong/Irisas)

This software and the multiple allelic function in Irisas have not been well tested yet.

All the multiallelic models implemented here have biases, the biallelic model is still the most "safe" model for association analysis.
